          Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level
          data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.
          Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make
          it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on
          most platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in
          C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension
          language for customizable applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every Python implementation comes with a number of built-in and standard modules. These
          are documented in The Python Standard Library.
          A few built-in modules are mentioned when they interact in a significant way with the 
          language definition.

        <p>Known implementations include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>CPython</strong> This is the original and most-maintained implementation of Python, 
            written in C. New language features generally appear here first.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Jython</strong> Python implemented in Java. This implementation can be used as a 
            scripting language for Java applications, or can be used to create applications using the 
            Java class libraries. It is also often used to create tests for Java libraries. More information 
            can be found at the Jython website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Python for .NET</strong> This implementation actually uses the CPython implementation, 
            but is a managed .NET application and makes .NET libraries available. It was created by Brian 
            Lloyd. For more information, see the Python for .NET home page.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>IronPython</strong> An alternate Python for .NET. Unlike Python.NET, this is a complete 
            Python implementation that generates IL, and compiles Python code directly to .NET assemblies. 
            It was created by Jim Hugunin, the original creator of Jython. For more information, see 
            the IronPython website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PyPy</strong> An implementation of Python written completely in Python. It supports 
            several advanced features not found in other implementations like stackless support and a 
            Just in Time compiler. One of the goals of the project is to encourage experimentation with 
            the language itself by making it easier to modify the interpreter (since it is written in Python). 
            Additional information is available on the PyPy project’s home page.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each of these implementations varies in some way from the language as documented in this manual, 
          or introduces specific information beyond what’s covered in the standard Python documentation. 
          Please refer to the implementation-specific documentation to determine what else you need to 
          know about the specific implementation you’re using.

        <p>
          The descriptions of lexical analysis and syntax use a modified BNF grammar notation. This uses 
          the following style of definition:
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
          
      name      ::=  lc_letter (lc_letter | "_")*
      lc_letter ::=  "a"..."z"
          </pre>
        </code>
        <p>
          The first line says that a <code>name</code> is an <code>lc_letter</code> followed by a sequence of zero
          or more <code>lc_letter</code>s and underscores. An <code>lc_letter</code> in turn is any of the single
          characters <code>'a'</code> through <code>'z'</code>. (This rule is actually adhered to for the names 
          defined in lexical and grammar rules in this document.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Each rule begins with a name (which is the name defined by the rule) and <code>::=</code>. A vertical
          bar (<code>|</code>) is used to separate alternatives; it is the least binding operator in this notation. 
          A star (<code>*</code>) means zero or more repetitions of the preceding item; likewise, a plus (<code>+</code>) 
          means one or more repetitions, and a phrase enclosed in square brackets (<code>[ ]</code>) means zero or 
          one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional). The <code>*</code> and <code>+</code> 
          operators bind as tightly as possible; parentheses are used for grouping. Literal strings are enclosed in quotes.
          White space is only meaningful to separate tokens. Rules are normally contained on a single line; rules with many
          alternatives may be formatted alternatively with each line after the first beginning with a vertical bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          In lexical definitions (as the example above), two more conventions are used: Two literal characters separated
          by three dots mean a choice of any single character in the given (inclusive) range of ASCII characters. A phrase
          between angular brackets (<code>&lsaquo;...&rsaquo;</code>) gives an informal description of the symbol
          defined; e.g., this could be used to describe the notion of ‘control character’ if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the notation used is almost the same, there is a big difference between the meaning of lexical and
          syntactic definitions: a lexical definition operates on the individual characters of the input source,
          while a syntax definition operates on the stream of tokens generated by the lexical analysis.

        <p>
          Python reads program text as Unicode code points; the encoding of a source file can be given by an
          encoding declaration and defaults to UTF-8, see PEP 3120 for details. If the source file cannot be decoded, a SyntaxError
          is raised.

      <header>Comments</header>
      <article>
        <p> 
          A comment starts with a hash character (<code>#</code>) that is not part of a string literal, and ends
          at the end of the physical line. A comment signifies the end of the logical line unless the implicit 
          line joining rules are invoked. Comments are ignored by the syntax.
